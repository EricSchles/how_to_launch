ToDo:

Pull in everyone's github and then analyze skills based on github accounts.

What we care about:

What languages to people know? How well?
What frameworks do people know? How well?

Value judgement:
By number of lines
By number of projects
By frequency of use of language 
(if you have 1 100000 line project that you wrote 4 years ago, you probably don't know the language very well anymore)
